# Force Field Parameters for RhoVRs in Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations

This repository contains the force field parameters for three RhoVR systems and their components, which were used in our Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. They were optimized based on the parameters generated by  CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) program with CGenFF version 4.4

## Systems Included
1. **RhoVR 1** 
2. **SPITIRT RhoVR 1**  
3. **RhoVR 1-4'** 
4. **Components of RhoVR 1**
5. **Components of SPITIRT RhoVR 1**  
6. **RhoVR 1-protonated**
